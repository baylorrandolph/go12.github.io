### The Verdict
> With only a single win out of six rounds, LastPass is, unfortunately, the loser of this comparison. Bitwarden offers enough in terms of features, security, pricing and support to be a better password manager. Bitwarden also has the benefit of available source code, meaning it’s much more flexible. 

> Winner: Bitwarden
